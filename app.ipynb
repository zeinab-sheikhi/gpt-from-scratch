    "Memory efficiency: The generator version (second one) is more memory efficient because it doesn't create an intermediate list. It generates each value on-the-fly as needed by join().\n",

    "Performance:\n",
    "For small sequences, the list comprehension might be slightly faster since it has less overhead\n",

    "For large sequences, the generator version is better as it uses less memory\n",
    "In most cases, the difference in performance would be negligible, but if you're working with very large sequences, the generator version (second one) would be the better choice due to its memory efficiency. Both will produce exactly the same output - they just differ in how they get there."
